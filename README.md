## üìñ Introduction

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on classifying iris flowers into three species using various machine learning algorithms and providing a user-friendly web application for predictions and insights.

---

## üéØ Why This Project

The primary motivation behind creating this project is to demonstrate the process of building a machine-learning model for classification tasks and to provide an educational tool for those interested in learning about machine learning and web application development.

---

## üìä Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the famous Iris dataset, which contains 150 samples of iris flowers with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Each sample is classified into one of three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.
